# Special-Traffic-Authorization
Project for Denatran, Federal Department of Traffic in Brazil for authorization of long vehicles on public roads

The project consists of checking bridges, tunnels, obstacles that may prevent vehicles longer than 20 meters from traveling on Brazilian public roads.

In the administrator panel, bridges, tunnels... must be registered, informing height and width where it will be compared with the size of the vehicle and if there is a possibility of traveling through the road.

Just mark the starting and ending points on the map and the route is traced and checked if there are any obstacles. The route can be redone directly from the map, changing the streets where a new verification will be performed automatically.

As they are very large vehicles, over 20 meters, some roads do not support the width and height of the vehicle.

This verification takes around 20 days to complete, but now we do it in less than 1 minute.

- Using geolocation with directionsService, displayRoute.

- Turf.js geospatial library

- Javascript, JQuery, Ajax, C# (admin)
